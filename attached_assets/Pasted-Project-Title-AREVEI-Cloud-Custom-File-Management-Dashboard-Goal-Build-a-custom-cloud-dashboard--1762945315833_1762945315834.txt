Project Title: AREVEI Cloud — Custom File Management Dashboard
Goal:
Build a custom cloud dashboard that runs locally or via IP (for now).
The app should let users manage files — upload, create folders, rename, delete, and preview — with a clean React frontend and Node.js backend.

🧱 Architecture Overview


Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Vite


Backend: Node.js + Express


Storage: Local filesystem (/uploads)


Database: Simple JSON or SQLite (for now) to store file metadata


Workflow:


User accesses dashboard via http://localhost:3000 (Replit preview)


Dashboard connects to backend API at http://localhost:5000


Files are stored locally in /uploads folder



🎨 Frontend Requirements
Build a modern dashboard UI for file management:


Left sidebar:


Dashboard


Files


Storage Usage


Settings




Topbar:


Search bar


User icon/profile




Main area:


List and grid view of files/folders


Upload button (drag & drop supported)


Create folder button


Sort, filter, and search files


Show file name, type, size, and last modified date




Responsive layout


Use AREVEI Blue (#4F46E5) as the accent color


Design should feel like Notion x Google Drive — minimal, fast, elegant



⚙️ Backend Requirements (Node.js + Express)


Serve API on port 5000


CORS enabled for frontend


Endpoints:


POST /api/upload → Upload file(s) to /uploads


GET /api/files → List all files/folders with metadata


DELETE /api/files/:name → Delete file by name


PUT /api/rename → Rename file or folder


POST /api/folder → Create new folder




Store metadata in a JSON file (files.json) for now


Use multer for uploads


Return JSON responses

🧠 Features to Implement


File upload (multiple)


Create new folder


Rename or delete file


Show file preview (for images & PDFs)


Display total storage usage


Smooth animations for file actions (Framer Motion)



🌐 Later Upgrades


Replace local /uploads with MinIO or S3


Add user authentication (JWT)


Add domain support (e.g., cloud.arevei.com)


Add AREVEI Agent connection (for local storage access)



Branding Info


Name: AREVEI Cloud


Color Theme: White background, #4F46E5 as primary accent, subtle gray borders


Typography: Inter or Poppins


Logo: Simple text “AREVEI Cloud” in sidebar top



Deliverables


Fully functional localhost setup (frontend + backend)


File upload, delete, rename, and list endpoints working


React dashboard connected to backend API


Simple storage usage indicator



Start building now.


Once it’s generated in Replit:


Run the backend first → it will host the API on port 5000


Then run the frontend → it will fetch from http://localhost:5000/api/...


Files will be stored in /backend/uploads/



Would you like me to also include a ready backend code template for Replit (Express + Multer upload + file listing) so you can paste it instantly and start running?
